                Hello, my name is Alexander Barajas, but I go by Zander!
                I'm a student here at Mesa college who is aspiring to transfer to UCSD. <br>
                I'm majoring in Computer Science like many of the other students in this class.
                However, my main interest actaully lies in Python and developing backends.
            </p>

            <p>
                I'm highly knowledgeable about video codecs, audio algorithms, and data structures.
                I decided to take this class to familarize myself with frontend development and create websites. <br>
                I've always found the process of web design intriguing and something to learn.
                My goal is to be able to use the skills obtained here in the real world and create job opportunities.
            </p>

            <p>
                Now you know what I'm here for and my coding background, however, that isn't all there is to me!
                In my free time, I often like to go surfing since I live so close to the beach. <br>
                When I'm not outside getting some fresh air, I love to watch movies and read books.
                This also includes watching anime and reading manga! Listed below are some of my favorites.
            </p>
